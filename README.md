# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The reason for designing this app was to understand the functionality of the many online calendars available. The ability to link different actions to dayjs current time functionality was inspirational. In this case a class was added to the time-blocks depending on whether they were past, present and future. There are many other uses for this functionality including reminders and overdue messages that would support users well. 

The problem this scheduler seeks to solve is organisation of time. People are increasingly looking for the digital support to manage their time and tasks effectively and reduce mental load. 

Building this app has taught me to use dayjs and has improved my skills with local storage and loops. jQuery has been an asset in this light, offering simplified ways to achieve the same result as vanilla javascript. For example, the removal of the need to stringify and JSONparse and the declaration of additional variables when using local storage.

## Credits
My tutor supported me to use jQuery to build the loop for the lines and lines of code I had written to store and retrieve user input from local storage.
